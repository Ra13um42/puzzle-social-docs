# Technology

Both, frontend and backend are built using web technologies. The frontend communicates with the backend using a REST-Api.

## Backend

The backend runs as a Node js application and is built using NestJs.<br>
NestJs is a modular framework, that resembles a typical model-view-controller structure.

### Database

To store it's data, the backend is using MongoDB (document database). The database needs no configuration, all structure is defined in the code.


# Frontend
